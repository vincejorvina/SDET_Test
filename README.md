Notes:

1.  Tools and libraries used:
        - Visual Studio Code with Extension Pack for Java
        - Maven
        - Cucumber
        - Selenium
    I have been running the tests by using 'mvn test' using VS Code terminal on the project folder path (the one containing 'pom.xml')
2.  The web page (https://demo.aspnetawesome.com/) currently does not look the same as on the screenshot on the PDF, so I assumed there have been changes ever since the PDF was created.
    Furthermore, I was unable to get Selenium to read any of the rows on any of the tables on the above page. However, I was able to get it to work on https://demo.aspnetawesome.com/GridDemo
    which is the one that looks very similar to the one on the PDF, so I used that page instead. Hopefully this is fine.
